So, I have decided to document my progress with this website, currently, its very much so in a 1/100th baked state, but considering im jumping deep into cloudflare workers + astro + integrating a CMS with oauth and heavy security + learning tailwind, I think

8/24/25

Update: Ive fooled and fooled with trying to get tailwinds float right to work, but it seems that i have something off with how i call for an image, more specifically, the images path, however its 12:30am and I am sick. I will take the current formatting of these text boxes as a win for tonight, and leave it be for now. I do need to add a method of automatically time stamping my updates to the projects as i babble on with them! Perhaps I should tag projects im currently doing with "In development" I think I shall!

1:30am same day

Update: I added a lil something to my main page, I couldnt go to bed knowing that was bare, ok NOW im going to bed!

Update: I have focused MUCH on making the page pretty, I attempted another CMS but turns out that was a waist of time, I am implementing some shadcn, quite happy with it so far! I made my repo private, I felt as if that would be a good course of action considering Im still learning this and security could quite possibly be a concern here. Though, I highly doubt it.
